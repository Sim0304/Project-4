Disaster Awareness Dashboard
Overview
In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, there's an increasing need for individuals and communities to understand the disaster risks associated with their regions. Recognizing the past and potential disasters enables better preparation for the future. Our team has undertaken a comprehensive analysis using datasets from the Australian government to identify the types of disasters most prevalent in specific states and areas.

This README provides an overview of our project, its objectives, and how stakeholders can benefit from the insights derived.
